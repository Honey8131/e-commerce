## Description

The E-commerce Back End project is an assignment that focuses on building the back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js and Sequelize. It enables an internet retail company to compete in the e-commerce market by leveraging the latest technologies. The project provides functionality to connect to a MySQL database, perform CRUD operations on categories, products, and tags, and demonstrate the usage of API routes using Insomnia Core.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, use the 'mysql2', 'sequelize', and 'dotenv' package. Mysql and sequelize will connect your Express.js API to a MYSQL database. Dotenv will store sensitive data.

## Usage
From /db/schema.sql, run the following commands:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
source schema.sql
exit
```
From /e-commerce, run the following commands:
```bash
npm run seed
npm start
```

You will also need the application Insomnia to send HTTP requests to the API and receive responses.
